    <p>Instead of keyboard this snake is controlled by your hand movements!</p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>To play with Gestures you need <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/max32655fthr.html">MAX32655FTHR</a> board, <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/max25405evkit.html">MAX25405EVKIT</a> and tools required for soldering (+ in Europe you need 3.3V@1A power supply like <a href="https://www.tme.eu/details/ama5er4-033160y/plug-in-power-supplies/aimtec/">this one</a> because MAX25405EVKIT contains power supply with US plug).</p>
    <p>For playing with gesture sensor you need do following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solder pin headers to MAX32655FTHR Board</li>
        <li>Connect EVKIT Shield With MAX32655FTHR Board.</li>
        <li>Connect EVKIT Sensor Board using ribbon cable to shield and MAX32655FTHR</li>
        <li>Plug power supply adapter and connect it to EVKIT Shield Board</li>
        <li>Connect USB Cable between your computer and MAX32655FTHR</li>
        <li>Download <a href="max32655_gestures_fw.hex">firmware</a> and drag-and-drop downlaoded file to DAPLINK thumbdrive</li>
        <li>Click the button and select the device: <button id="connect-max25405">Connect IR Gesture Sensor</button></li>
